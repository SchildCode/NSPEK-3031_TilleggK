# NSPEK-3031_TilleggK
- Simulation of hourly heat pump performance with with macro-enabled bilinear interpolation of capacity and COP in accordance with European standards EN 13612-2, EN 14825, and Norwegian Technical Specification SN NSPEK 3031:2020.
- The workbook also calculates part-load COP using a relation between PLF vs PLF. This is done in a flexible way that can handle any heat pump (both single-speed and variable-speed compressors for air/air, air/water, water/air or water/water heat pumps). This approach is an improvement upon EN 13612-2, EN 14825, but still compliant by adjusting the 3 coefficients.
- The workbook is partly in Norwegian.
- The workbook contains example sheets for 4 different heat pump applications:
  1. Space heating only
  2. Domestic hot water production
  3. Simultaneous production of space heating and domestic hot water from the same primary circuit 
  4. Heat pump with 3-way valve to switch between prodicing high-temperature heat to domestic hot water, and low-temperature heat to space heating
- In addition, the workbook has a spreadsheet to visualize part load profiles (PLR vs PLF), and a separate sheet for generating a year of hourly loads for space heating and domestic hot water.
