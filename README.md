# NSPEK-3031_TilleggK
- Simulation of hourly heat pump performance with with the bilinear interpolation of capacity, COP and part load factors in accordance with EN 13612-2, EN 14825, and Norwegian Technical Specificaion SN NSPEK 3031:2020.
- The workbook is partly in Norwegian.
- The workbook contains 4 example sheets for different heat pump applications:
  - space heating only
  - domestic hot water production
  - space heating and domestic hot water from the same primary circuit 
  - heat pump with 3-way valve to switch between prodicing high-temperature heat to domestic hot water, and low-temperature heat to space heating
- In addition, the workbook has a spreadsheet to visualize pat load profiles (PLR vs PLF), and a separate sheet for genrating a year of hourly values of load for space heating and domestic hot water.
